### *** New functions ***

Using opacity effects on full-color screens can add a cool visual touch, but implementing it with MicroPython's FrameBuffer and RGB565 format comes with challenges.

The default pixel() function in FrameBuffer doesnâ€™t interpret colors consistently, so custom functions, setPixel() and getPixel(), were created to ensure accurate color handling. Additionally, a universal color() function was added to work as an interpreter for 16-bit RGB565 color formats. This setup also includes opacity functions to enable smooth blending effects on the screen.
